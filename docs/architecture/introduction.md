# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **CVR College Bus Tracker**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis, this is a **greenfield project** with specific technology preferences indicated:

- **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development  
- **Node.js with Express** for backend API
- **MongoDB** for database with TTL collections
- **WebSocket with Socket.IO** for real-time location broadcasting
- **Monorepo structure** explicitly requested

**Recommended Starter Templates:**
1. **T3 Stack Mobile** (React Native + tRPC + Prisma) - Good for type safety
2. **React Native Monorepo Template** with Nx - Matches monorepo requirement  
3. **Custom setup** following PRD specifications - Most aligned with stated preferences

**Decision:** Proceed with custom architecture following PRD specifications exactly - N/A for starter template.
