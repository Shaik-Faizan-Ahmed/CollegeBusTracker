**Session Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary  
**Participant:** CollegeBusTracker Developer  

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** CVR College Bus Tracker App Development

**Session Goals:** Broad exploration of features, user experience, technical approaches, and opportunities for the college bus tracking application

**Techniques Used:** Question Storming, Role Playing, "Yes, And..." Building

**Total Ideas Generated:** 25+ distinct ideas across multiple stakeholder perspectives

### Key Themes Identified:
- User experience simplicity and reliability are critical
- Multiple stakeholder needs (students, drivers, administrators, parents)
- Push notifications and automation features
- Backup systems when trackers are unavailable
- Privacy and location control concerns
- Infrastructure challenges (internet connectivity, app adoption)

## Technique Sessions

### Question Storming - 15 minutes

**Description:** Generate questions to uncover hidden opportunities and challenges before jumping into solutions

**Ideas Generated:**
1. What is going to make them use this app?
2. Why will it be better than calling his friend to know his location?
3. How simple is the user experience?
4. How reliable is it going to be?
5. How much usage will it provide to the users?
6. What if the person needs reminders irrespective of whether to open the app or not?
7. What if there is no internet in some areas from where the bus comes?
8. What if the tracker doesn't want the app to still share his location after the end of bus journey?
9. What if there are no trackers? Will others get notifications?
10. What if a person forgets to start becoming tracker - will he get notified to do so?

**Insights Discovered:**
- Value proposition needs to be clearly better than informal solutions (calling friends)
- Reliability and simplicity are make-or-break factors
- Edge cases around tracker availability and internet connectivity are critical
- Privacy controls for location sharing are important
- Automated reminders and notifications are expected features

**Notable Connections:**
- User adoption directly tied to reliability and simplicity
- Technical challenges (connectivity, tracker availability) impact core value proposition
- Privacy concerns must be balanced with functionality needs

### Role Playing - 20 minutes

**Description:** Explore the app from different stakeholder perspectives to uncover diverse needs and requirements

**Ideas Generated:**

**Bus Driver Perspective:**
1. Minimal driver involvement (students manage the technology)
2. Delay notification system where trackers can alert students
3. Include reasons for delays (traffic, breakdown, route changes)

**Transportation Administrator Perspective:**
4. Feature to constantly add new buses to the system
5. Ability to add new bus stops
6. Update/modify existing bus stops

**Consumer-Only Student Perspective:**
7. Push notifications 5 minutes before bus arrives (even when app is closed)

**Parent Perspective:**
8. High reliability is essential for parent trust

**Insights Discovered:**
- Different stakeholders have very different technical comfort levels
- Administrative features needed for system maintenance and updates
- Passive users want automation without active engagement
- Trust and reliability are crucial for parent buy-in

**Notable Connections:**
- Driver preference for minimal involvement aligns with student-managed tracker system
- Administrative needs suggest potential institutional partnership opportunities
- Parent concerns about reliability reinforce technical requirements

### "Yes, And..." Building - 10 minutes

**Description:** Collaboratively build and enhance ideas through progressive development

**Ideas Generated:**
1. 5-minute advance push notifications for bus arrival
2. Users specify bus number and stop in advance in settings
3. Save multiple bus/stop combinations as "favorites"
4. Ad-hoc bus tracking by typing bus number
5. "Recent buses" list for quick selection
6. "Your Bus" shortcut directly on main screen

**Insights Discovered:**
- Flexibility between saved preferences and spontaneous usage is important
- User experience should minimize friction through shortcuts and memory features
- Main screen real estate should prioritize most common user actions

**Notable Connections:**
- Settings-based configuration enables automation features
- Recent history and shortcuts reduce cognitive load for repeat users
- Main screen design directly impacts daily user experience

## Idea Categorization

### MVP Core Features
*Essential features for the minimum viable product*

1. **Two-Option Main Screen**
   - Description: Simple welcome screen with "Track Bus" and "Become Tracker" options
   - Why MVP: Core user flow, essential functionality
   - Resources needed: Basic UI design, main navigation

2. **Track Bus Flow**
   - Description: User enters bus number, sees live location on map
   - Why MVP: Primary value proposition for bus riders
   - Resources needed: Map integration, real-time location display

3. **Become Tracker Flow**
   - Description: User enters bus number, starts sharing location as tracker
   - Why MVP: Essential for providing location data to other users
   - Resources needed: Location services, data transmission

### Post-MVP Features
*Features for future implementation after core functionality*

1. **"Your Bus" Main Screen Shortcut**
   - Description: Prominent shortcut on main screen for instant access to user's primary bus
   - Why post-MVP: Nice-to-have UX enhancement, not essential for core functionality
   - Resources needed: UI design, user preferences storage

2. **Recent Buses Quick Selection**
   - Description: List of recently tracked buses for easy re-selection
   - Why post-MVP: Convenience feature, reduces friction but not essential
   - Resources needed: Local storage implementation, UI list component

3. **Bus Stop Selection & ETA**
   - Description: Allow users to select their stop and see estimated arrival time
   - Why post-MVP: Advanced feature that requires complex calculations
   - Resources needed: Route mapping, ETA algorithms

### Future Innovations
*Ideas requiring development/research*

1. **5-Minute Advance Push Notifications**
   - Description: Automated notifications before bus arrival, even when app is closed
   - Development needed: Push notification infrastructure, location prediction algorithms
   - Timeline estimate: 3-4 months

2. **Administrative Management Dashboard**

### Insights & Learnings

- **Reliability trumps features**: Users and parents prioritize dependable service over advanced functionality
- **Stakeholder complexity**: Success requires balancing needs of students, drivers, administrators, and parents
- **Adoption chicken-and-egg**: App requires critical mass of trackers to be valuable, but trackers need incentives to participate
- **Privacy boundaries matter**: Location sharing controls are essential for user comfort and adoption
- **Informal competition exists**: App must clearly outperform existing informal solutions (calling friends)

## Action Planning

### MVP Development Priorities
