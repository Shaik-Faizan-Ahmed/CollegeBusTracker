# CVR College Bus Tracker Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Provide real-time bus location tracking to eliminate daily transportation uncertainty for CVR College students
• Create a peer-to-peer tracking ecosystem where students contribute and consume location data
• Reduce unnecessary waiting time at bus stops by 25% through reliable location information
• Achieve 40% adoption rate among transportation-dependent students within 6 months
• Maintain 85% tracker availability during peak hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) within 4 months
• Replace unreliable informal solutions (calling friends) with dependable digital information system

### Background Context
CVR College students currently face daily frustration with campus bus transportation due to unpredictable arrival times and lack of real-time information. Students rely on inefficient informal networks like calling friends, leading to missed buses, extended wait times, and disrupted schedules. This affects the entire college community daily, with students wasting time and experiencing unnecessary stress around basic transportation needs.

The proposed solution leverages a student-driven peer-to-peer model where students use smartphones they already carry to share location data when aboard buses. This approach eliminates expensive hardware requirements while creating reliable coverage through single active tracker per bus with seamless handover capability, specifically optimized for CVR College's transportation patterns.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The CVR College Bus Tracker prioritizes immediate usability over feature complexity, designed for students who need quick, reliable information during busy campus life. The interface follows a "two-tap maximum" principle - users should access core functionality within two screen interactions. Visual design emphasizes clarity and speed, with large, easily tappable interface elements optimized for one-handed mobile use during walking or waiting.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Binary Choice Architecture:** Main screen presents only two clear options ("Track Bus" / "Become Tracker"), eliminating decision paralysis
- **Input-Minimization:** Bus number entry uses numeric keypad with auto-suggestions and recent bus memory
- **Map-Centric Display:** Location information presented primarily through visual map interface rather than text-heavy lists
- **Status-Aware Feedback:** Clear visual and text indicators for tracker availability, connection status, and user role

### Core Screens and Views
- **Welcome Screen:** Simple two-button interface with app branding and connection status
- **Bus Number Entry:** Numeric input with keypad optimization and validation feedback
- **Map View (Consumer):** Full-screen map showing requested bus location with zoom/pan controls
- **Map View (Tracker):** Similar map view with tracking controls and "Stop Tracking" prominence
- **Status/Error Screens:** Clear messaging for no-tracker-available, connection issues, and permission requests

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The app will meet WCAG AA standards including sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum), screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements, and keyboard navigation support. Text will be readable at 200% zoom without horizontal scrolling, and all functionality will be accessible through screen readers for visually impaired students.

### Branding
Clean, modern interface reflecting college student expectations for mobile apps. Color palette uses high-contrast combinations for outdoor visibility (bright sunlight at bus stops). Visual design avoids corporate complexity in favor of friendly, approachable aesthetics that encourage peer participation and community building.

### Target Device and Platforms: React Native Mobile App
Native mobile application built with React Native for cross-platform deployment to Android and iOS devices. This approach provides optimal GPS accuracy, battery optimization, and native performance essential for real-time location tracking. Interface optimizes for smartphone screens with native mobile UI patterns and gestures familiar to college students.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both React Native mobile application and backend API with shared utilities, data models, and configuration. This approach supports the rapid development timeline (3-4 months) and single developer team by simplifying dependency management and deployment coordination.

### Service Architecture
**Monolith with Real-time Services:** Core application built as a Node.js monolith with Express framework for rapid development, enhanced with dedicated WebSocket service for real-time location streaming. This hybrid approach balances development speed with the performance requirements for live tracking while avoiding microservices complexity that would overwhelm a single developer team.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
Comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints and WebSocket connections, and basic end-to-end testing for critical user flows. Manual testing convenience methods for location simulation and tracker state management during development. Focus on automated testing for core tracking functionality and error scenarios.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology:**
- React Native for cross-platform mobile development (Android primary, iOS secondary)
- Native GPS APIs for accurate location tracking and sharing
- React Native Maps with Google Maps integration for interactive mapping functionality

**Backend Infrastructure:**
- Node.js with Express for rapid development and JavaScript ecosystem consistency
- WebSocket implementation using Socket.IO for real-time location broadcasting
- MongoDB for flexible location data storage with TTL collections for data cleanup
- Redis for session management and real-time location caching

**Hosting and Deployment:**
- Cloud platform (AWS or Google Cloud) with auto-scaling capabilities for academic period usage spikes
- Docker containerization for consistent deployment across development and production environments
- CI/CD pipeline supporting rapid iteration and deployment cycles

**Security and Privacy:**
- HTTPS/WSS encryption for all data transmission
- Location data stored with 24-hour retention using MongoDB TTL collections for automatic cleanup
- Tracker session data retained for 24 hours with automatic expiration
- No persistent personal identification storage - session-based user management only
- Clear consent flow for location sharing with ability to revoke permissions

**Development Tools:**
- Git with feature branch workflow for single developer efficiency
- Environment-based configuration management (development, staging, production)
- Automated deployment pipeline triggered by main branch updates
- Basic monitoring and error tracking for production stability
