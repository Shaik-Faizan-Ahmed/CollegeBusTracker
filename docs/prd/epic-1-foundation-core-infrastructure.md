# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish a solid technical foundation with React Native mobile app framework, backend API infrastructure, and basic user interface that delivers immediate value through the two-screen navigation while setting up all development and deployment systems needed for the complete application.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment
**As a** developer,
**I want** a complete React Native project with backend API setup and all necessary development tools configured,
**so that** I can efficiently develop and deploy the bus tracking application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. React Native project initialized with proper folder structure and dependencies
2. Node.js backend API with Express framework setup and basic routing
3. Database (MongoDB) connection configured and tested
4. Development environment supports hot reloading for both frontend and backend
5. Git repository configured with proper .gitignore and initial commit structure
6. Basic CI/CD pipeline established for automated testing and deployment

## Story 1.2: Mobile App Foundation and Navigation
**As a** CVR College student,
**I want** to open the bus tracker app and see a clean interface with clear navigation options,
**so that** I can immediately understand how to use the app's core features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. App launches successfully on both Android and iOS devices
2. Welcome screen displays with app branding and two clear button options: "Track Bus" and "Become Tracker"
3. Navigation between screens works smoothly without crashes
4. App handles device orientation changes properly
5. Basic styling follows mobile UI best practices with appropriate touch targets
6. App requests necessary permissions (location) with clear user messaging

## Story 1.3: Location Services Integration
**As a** mobile app user,
**I want** the app to access my device's GPS location when I grant permission,
**so that** I can participate as a bus tracker when needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. App requests location permissions with clear explanation of usage
2. GPS location can be accessed and displayed with reasonable accuracy (within 20 meters)
3. Location services work on both Android and iOS platforms
4. App handles permission denial gracefully with appropriate user messaging
5. Location updates can be started and stopped programmatically
6. Battery optimization considerations implemented for continuous location tracking

## Story 1.4: Basic Backend API and Database Operations
**As a** system,
**I want** to store and retrieve bus location data through a reliable API,
**so that** trackers can share locations and consumers can view them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. REST API endpoints created for basic location data operations (create, read)
2. Database schema designed for storing bus locations with timestamps
3. API handles bus number validation and location data format
4. Basic error handling and logging implemented
5. API documentation created for frontend integration
6. Data persistence verified through API testing

## Story 1.5: Deployment Pipeline and Hosting Setup
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated deployment of both mobile app builds and backend services,
**so that** I can quickly iterate and deploy updates throughout development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Backend API deployed to cloud hosting platform with public URL
2. Database hosted and accessible from deployed backend
3. Mobile app can be built for both Android and iOS platforms
4. Automated deployment triggered by code commits to main branch
5. Environment configuration supports development, staging, and production
6. Basic monitoring and error tracking implemented for deployed services
