# Epic 3: User Experience & Polish

**Epic Goal:** Transform the working bus tracking system into a production-ready mobile application with comprehensive error handling, user feedback, performance optimization, and app store deployment preparation, ensuring reliable daily use by CVR College students.

## Story 3.1: Connection Status and Error Handling
**As a** student using the app,
**I want** clear feedback when the app has connectivity issues or encounters errors,
**so that** I understand why tracking information isn't available and what I can do about it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Connection status indicator shows online/offline state clearly
2. Graceful handling of poor network connectivity with user-friendly messaging
3. Retry mechanisms for failed location updates with exponential backoff
4. Clear error messages for common scenarios (no GPS, permissions denied, server unavailable)
5. App functions reasonably in offline mode with cached data where possible
6. Loading states displayed during data fetching operations

## Story 3.2: Tracker Session Management
**As a** tracker,
**I want** reliable session management that handles interruptions and provides clear status feedback,
**so that** I can confidently share my location without worrying about technical issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Tracker session persists through app backgrounding and foreground return
2. Automatic session cleanup when app is forcibly closed or crashes
3. Battery optimization warnings and recommendations for continuous tracking
4. Clear visual feedback showing tracking status and data transmission success
5. Ability to pause and resume tracking session during brief stops
6. Session timeout handling after extended periods of inactivity

## Story 3.3: Performance Optimization and Resource Management
**As a** mobile app user,
**I want** the app to run smoothly without draining battery or consuming excessive data,
**so that** I can use it regularly without impacting my device performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Map rendering optimized for smooth performance on target devices
2. Location update frequency balanced between accuracy and battery consumption
3. Memory usage optimized to prevent crashes on lower-end devices
4. Data usage minimized through efficient location data compression
5. Background processing optimized to reduce battery drain
6. App launch time consistently under 3 seconds on target hardware

## Story 3.4: User Interface Polish and Accessibility
**As a** student,
**I want** an intuitive, polished interface that works well for all users including those with accessibility needs,
**so that** the app is inclusive and pleasant to use daily.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Visual design refined with consistent styling, colors, and typography
2. Touch targets sized appropriately for mobile interaction (minimum 44px)
3. Screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users
4. High contrast mode support and color accessibility compliance
5. Smooth animations and transitions between screens
6. Responsive design works well across different screen sizes and orientations

## Story 3.5: App Store Preparation and Deployment
**As a** project stakeholder,
**I want** the app properly packaged and deployed to app stores,
**so that** CVR College students can easily discover and install the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. App icons, splash screens, and store assets created for both platforms
2. App store listings prepared with descriptions, screenshots, and metadata
3. Android APK and iOS IPA builds generated and tested on physical devices
4. App store compliance requirements met (privacy policy, content ratings, etc.)
5. Beta testing distribution setup for initial user feedback collection
6. Production release builds signed and ready for store submission
