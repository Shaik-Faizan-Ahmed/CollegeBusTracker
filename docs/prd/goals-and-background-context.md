# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Provide real-time bus location tracking to eliminate daily transportation uncertainty for CVR College students
• Create a peer-to-peer tracking ecosystem where students contribute and consume location data
• Reduce unnecessary waiting time at bus stops by 25% through reliable location information
• Achieve 40% adoption rate among transportation-dependent students within 6 months
• Maintain 85% tracker availability during peak hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) within 4 months
• Replace unreliable informal solutions (calling friends) with dependable digital information system

## Background Context
CVR College students currently face daily frustration with campus bus transportation due to unpredictable arrival times and lack of real-time information. Students rely on inefficient informal networks like calling friends, leading to missed buses, extended wait times, and disrupted schedules. This affects the entire college community daily, with students wasting time and experiencing unnecessary stress around basic transportation needs.

The proposed solution leverages a student-driven peer-to-peer model where students use smartphones they already carry to share location data when aboard buses. This approach eliminates expensive hardware requirements while creating reliable coverage through single active tracker per bus with seamless handover capability, specifically optimized for CVR College's transportation patterns.
