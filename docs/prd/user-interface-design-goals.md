# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The CVR College Bus Tracker prioritizes immediate usability over feature complexity, designed for students who need quick, reliable information during busy campus life. The interface follows a "two-tap maximum" principle - users should access core functionality within two screen interactions. Visual design emphasizes clarity and speed, with large, easily tappable interface elements optimized for one-handed mobile use during walking or waiting.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Binary Choice Architecture:** Main screen presents only two clear options ("Track Bus" / "Become Tracker"), eliminating decision paralysis
- **Input-Minimization:** Bus number entry uses numeric keypad with auto-suggestions and recent bus memory
- **Map-Centric Display:** Location information presented primarily through visual map interface rather than text-heavy lists
- **Status-Aware Feedback:** Clear visual and text indicators for tracker availability, connection status, and user role

## Core Screens and Views
- **Welcome Screen:** Simple two-button interface with app branding and connection status
- **Bus Number Entry:** Numeric input with keypad optimization and validation feedback
- **Map View (Consumer):** Full-screen map showing requested bus location with zoom/pan controls
- **Map View (Tracker):** Similar map view with tracking controls and "Stop Tracking" prominence
- **Status/Error Screens:** Clear messaging for no-tracker-available, connection issues, and permission requests

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The app will meet WCAG AA standards including sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum), screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements, and keyboard navigation support. Text will be readable at 200% zoom without horizontal scrolling, and all functionality will be accessible through screen readers for visually impaired students.

## Branding
Clean, modern interface reflecting college student expectations for mobile apps. Color palette uses high-contrast combinations for outdoor visibility (bright sunlight at bus stops). Visual design avoids corporate complexity in favor of friendly, approachable aesthetics that encourage peer participation and community building.

## Target Device and Platforms: React Native Mobile App
Native mobile application built with React Native for cross-platform deployment to Android and iOS devices. This approach provides optimal GPS accuracy, battery optimization, and native performance essential for real-time location tracking. Interface optimizes for smartphone screens with native mobile UI patterns and gestures familiar to college students.
