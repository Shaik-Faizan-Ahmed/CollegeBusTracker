# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  While the architectural foundation is solid with excellent validation, error handling, 
  and code organization, the story cannot be marked as complete due to:
  
  1. Controllers containing only placeholder implementations instead of real business logic
  2. Test suite failures preventing verification of data persistence (AC-6)  
  3. Missing API documentation required by AC-5
  
  The security and architectural design are excellent, but the core functionality
  is not yet implemented. Recommend completing business logic implementation and
  fixing test infrastructure before final approval.
