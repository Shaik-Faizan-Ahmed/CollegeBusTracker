## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Monorepo structure with yarn workspaces successfully implemented
- React Native app initialized with TypeScript and all required dependencies
- Configuration services pattern established for environment variables
- Testing framework (Jest + React Native Testing Library) configured and ready

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **React Navigation**: Use latest v6+ for screen navigation
- **React Native CLI**: 0.72+ already configured in Story 1.1
- **Location Services**: @react-native-community/geolocation 3.0+ for permission handling
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4+ for app state management
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library already configured

### Project Structure Requirements  
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
File locations for new components:
```
apps/mobile/src/
├── screens/
│   ├── HomeScreen/           # Welcome screen with two-button interface
│   ├── TrackBusScreen/      # Consumer interface (placeholder)
│   └── BecomeTrackerScreen/ # Tracker interface (placeholder)
├── components/
│   └── common/              # Reusable UI components
└── services/
    └── navigation.ts        # Navigation utilities
```

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- HomeScreen should be the primary entry point matching state: 'home'
- Navigation should update currentScreen state in Zustand store
- Component organization follows apps/mobile/src/screens/ pattern
- Screen components should be self-contained with index.ts exports

### State Management Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Required Zustand store interface:
```typescript
interface AppState {
  currentScreen: 'home' | 'track' | 'tracker' | 'map';
  userRole: 'consumer' | 'tracker' | null;
  // Navigation methods
  navigateToScreen: (screen: string) => void;
}
```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Component Naming**: PascalCase (e.g., `HomeScreen.tsx`, `TrackBusScreen.tsx`)
- **Type Sharing**: Define screen navigation types in packages/shared-types
- **State Updates**: Use Zustand store methods, never mutate state directly
- **File Organization**: Each screen component in its own directory with index.ts

### Permission Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use @react-native-community/geolocation 3.0+ for native GPS access
- Implement clear user messaging for permission requests
- Handle permission denial gracefully with fallback messaging
- Ensure permissions work on both Android and iOS platforms

### Mobile UI Best Practices
- Touch targets minimum 44px x 44px for accessibility
- Use appropriate spacing and typography scales
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability
- Test on various screen sizes and orientations
- Implement proper loading states and user feedback

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
Test file locations:
```
apps/mobile/__tests__/
├── screens/
│   ├── HomeScreen.test.tsx
│   ├── TrackBusScreen.test.tsx
│   └── BecomeTrackerScreen.test.tsx
└── components/
    └── navigation.test.ts
```

Test Requirements:
- Use Jest + React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Test component rendering and user interactions
- Test navigation functions and screen transitions
- Test permission request flows
- Test orientation handling
- Verify accessibility features
