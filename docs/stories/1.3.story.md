└── store/
    └── index.ts                 # Extended Zustand store with location tracking
```

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Required Zustand store extensions:
```typescript
interface AppState {
  currentLocation: Location | null;       // Current GPS location
  isLocationTracking: boolean;            // Tracking session status
  locationPermissionStatus: 'granted' | 'denied' | 'unknown';
  locationAccuracy: number | null;        // Location accuracy in meters
  locationLoadingState: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
  locationError: string | null;           // Location error message
  
  // Location methods
  startLocationTracking: () => Promise<void>;
  stopLocationTracking: () => void;
  updateLocation: (location: Location) => void;
  setLocationError: (error: string | null) => void;
  setLocationLoadingState: (state: string) => void;
}
```

### Location Display Components Specifications
Required UI components for location feedback:
```typescript
// LocationStatus component props
interface LocationStatusProps {
  location: Location | null;
  accuracy: number | null;
  isTracking: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

// GPSIndicator component props  
interface GPSIndicatorProps {
  signalStrength: 'none' | 'weak' | 'good' | 'excellent';
  accuracy: number | null;
}

// LocationSpinner component props
interface LocationSpinnerProps {
  isLoading: boolean;
  message?: string;
}
```

### Location Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface Location {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface LocationUpdate {
  busNumber: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;
  timestamp: number;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Service Naming**: camelCase for service methods (e.g., `startLocationTracking`, `stopLocationTracking`)
- **Hook Naming**: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useLocation.ts`)
- **Type Sharing**: Use Location interface from packages/shared-types
- **State Updates**: Use Zustand store methods, never mutate state directly
- **Error Handling**: All location errors must be handled gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Location Service Specifications
Based on existing permission service implementation from Story 1.2:
- Extend existing `apps/mobile/src/services/permissions.ts` with continuous tracking
- Location accuracy requirement: within 20 meters for bus tracking purposes
- Update frequency: optimized for battery life vs accuracy trade-off
- Support both foreground and background location tracking
- Handle location service availability and GPS signal quality

### Location Error Handling Requirements
Comprehensive error scenarios to handle:
- **GPS Unavailable**: Device GPS is disabled or unavailable
- **Poor Signal**: GPS signal is too weak for accurate positioning
- **Timeout Errors**: Location acquisition takes too long (>30 seconds)
- **Permission Denied**: User denies location permission requests
- **Service Disabled**: Location services disabled at system level
- **Network Issues**: A-GPS data unavailable affecting accuracy
- **Battery Optimization**: System-level battery optimization blocking location
- **Background Restrictions**: Platform restrictions on background location access

### User Feedback and Loading States
Required user feedback patterns:
- **Loading State**: "Getting your location..." with spinner during GPS acquisition
- **Accuracy Status**: Visual indicator showing location accuracy (excellent/good/fair/poor)
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- **Permission Education**: Clear explanations of why location access is needed
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Easy retry options for failed location attempts
- **Battery Impact**: Inform users about battery usage during continuous tracking

### Battery Optimization Requirements
- Implement intelligent location update frequency (slower when stationary, faster when moving)
- Use device motion detection to optimize GPS usage
- Configure location accuracy settings based on tracking mode
- Provide user feedback about battery usage during continuous tracking

### Cross-Platform Location Handling
- Android: Handle location permission changes and background location access
- iOS: Handle location permission levels (whenInUse vs always)
- Consistent location data format across both platforms
- Platform-specific error handling for location services

- **BecomeTrackerScreen**: Show real-time location accuracy, GPS signal strength, and tracking status
- **Navigation State**: Update Zustand store to include location-related navigation states
- **User Flow**: Seamless integration with existing two-button navigation pattern from Story 1.2

### UI/UX Consistency Requirements
Maintain consistency with Story 1.2 mobile UI patterns:
- Follow established component styling and layout patterns
- Use consistent typography and color schemes
