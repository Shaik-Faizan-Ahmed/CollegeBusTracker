### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Hosting Platform**: Render.com free tier for backend API hosting with automatic deployments
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL 15+ already configured with free tier
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment workflows
- **Mobile Builds**: React Native CLI 0.72+ for native Android/iOS builds
- **Monitoring**: Sentry free tier (5k errors/month) for error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Environment**: Node.js 18+ with Express.js backend framework

```

### Deployment Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
**Backend Deployment Configuration:**
- **Platform**: Render.com free tier with Git-based continuous deployment
- **Build Command**: `yarn install && yarn workspace backend build`
- **Start Command**: `yarn workspace backend start`
- **Public URL**: `cvr-bus-tracker.onrender.com` (or assigned by Render)
- **Environment**: Node.js 18+ runtime with automatic scaling

**Mobile Build Configuration:**
- **Android Build**: `cd apps/mobile && npx react-native build-android`
- **iOS Build**: `cd apps/mobile && npx react-native build-ios`
- **Output Directories**: 
  - Android: `apps/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/`
  - iOS: `apps/mobile/ios/build/Build/Products/`

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
GitHub Actions workflow structure:
```yaml
# Backend deployment trigger
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['apps/backend/**']

# Testing and deployment steps
jobs:
  - Setup Node.js 18 with Yarn cache
  - Install dependencies with frozen lockfile
  - Run backend test suite (Jest + Supertest)
  - Deploy to Render.com using API key
  - Verify deployment health check
```

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Environment management standards:
- **No Direct process.env Access**: All environment variables accessed through config objects
- **Environment-Specific Files**: Separate .env files for development/production
- **Variable Validation**: Required environment variables validated at startup
- **Fallback Values**: Default values provided for non-critical configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**
```typescript
// Production environment variables
SUPABASE_URL=https://bmhruvfthinvkebgavk.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<production_service_key>
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
SENTRY_DSN=<sentry_project_dsn>
```

### Database Hosting Requirements
Database is already hosted on Supabase with:
- **PostgreSQL 15+** with real-time capabilities
- **Free tier**: 500MB storage, 2GB bandwidth
- **Connection**: Service role key for backend operations
- **Schema**: bus_sessions table with proper indexes and constraints

**Migration Deployment:**
- Database schema already defined in `apps/backend/migrations/001_create_bus_sessions.sql`
- Migration service implemented but requires manual execution
- Production database needs initial schema setup

### Mobile Build Requirements
React Native CLI build configuration:
- **Android**: Requires Android SDK 31+, build tools 30.0.3
- **iOS**: Requires Xcode 14+, iOS 12+ deployment target
- **Signing**: Debug builds for development, release builds require proper signing
- **Output**: APK for Android, IPA for iOS distribution

### Error Tracking and Monitoring
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
Sentry integration requirements:
- **Backend Integration**: Express.js error handler middleware
- **Environment**: Separate Sentry projects for development/production
- **Error Context**: Include user context, request data, and environment information
- **Performance**: Transaction monitoring for API endpoints
- **Alerts**: Configure notifications for critical errors

### Testing Requirements for CI/CD
Automated testing in deployment pipeline:
- **Backend Tests**: Jest + Supertest API endpoint testing
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds before deployment
- **Environment**: Use test database for integration tests
- **Failure Handling**: Block deployment if tests fail

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Configuration Files**: Use TypeScript for config objects with proper types
- **Build Scripts**: Consistent naming in package.json across workspaces
- **Environment Variables**: Validate required variables at application startup
- **Error Handling**: All deployment processes must include proper error handling and rollback

### Project Structure Alignment
File locations must follow established patterns:
- CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Environment configs in respective app directories
- Build scripts in `scripts/` directory for shared automation
- Documentation updates in `docs/` for deployment procedures

### Integration Points
Deployment must work with existing architecture:
- **Database Connection**: Use existing databaseService.ts with production credentials
- **API Endpoints**: All existing routes (`/api/health`, `/api/buses`, `/api/tracker`) must work
- **Environment Detection**: Server must detect production environment and adjust logging
- **CORS Configuration**: Allow mobile app to connect to deployed backend

### Security Considerations
- **Environment Secrets**: Never commit production credentials to repository
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and validation middleware already implemented
- **Database Access**: Use service role key, never expose anon key in backend
- **HTTPS**: Render.com provides automatic SSL certificates
- **CORS**: Configure allowed origins for production environment

### Performance Optimization
- **Build Process**: Optimize Docker builds and dependency installation
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling already implemented
- **Caching**: Cache service ready for production use
- **Static Assets**: Minimal static assets for API-only backend

### Monitoring and Alerting
Required monitoring setup:
- **Health Checks**: Existing `/api/health` endpoint for uptime monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for error logging and alerts
- **Performance**: Basic response time monitoring
- **Database**: Connection status and query performance
- **Deployment**: Build and deployment status notifications
