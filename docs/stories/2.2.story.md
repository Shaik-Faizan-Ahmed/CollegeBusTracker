# Story 2.2: Become Tracker Functionality

5. "Stop Tracking" button prominently accessible to end tracking session
6. Location updates sent to backend every 10-15 seconds while tracking active
7. App prevents device sleep/lock while actively tracking

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion:
- Bus number validation system is complete with CVR College format support (1-50, A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C10)
- Location services are established and working on both Android and iOS
- Zustand state management is configured and ready for tracker state
- React Navigation setup supports parameter passing from bus selection to tracker screen
- AsyncStorage service is available for session persistence

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Express.js + Socket.IO 4.18+ / 4.7+**: Backend REST API + Real-time WebSocket for location broadcasting
- **React Native CLI 0.72+**: Full native access for GPS tracking and device sleep prevention  
- **@react-native-community/geolocation 3.0+**: Native GPS access for continuous location tracking
- **Zustand 4.4+**: Lightweight state management for tracker session state
- **react-native-keep-awake**: Keep device awake during active tracking sessions

### Backend API Integration
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**POST /tracker/start** endpoint requirements:
```typescript
// Request body
{
  busNumber: string,    // Validated bus number from Story 2.1
  latitude: number,     // Current GPS latitude 
  longitude: number     // Current GPS longitude
}

// Success response (201)
{
  sessionId: string,    // Unique session identifier for WebSocket auth
  busNumber: string,    // Confirmed bus number being tracked
  trackerId: string     // Anonymous tracker identifier
}

// Conflict response (409) 
{
  error: {
    code: 'BUS_ALREADY_TRACKED',
    message: 'Bus already has an active tracker',
    existingTracker: {
      busNumber: string,
      lastUpdated: Date,
      trackerId: string
    }
  }
}
```

**POST /tracker/stop** endpoint for ending sessions:
```typescript
// Request headers
'x-session-id': sessionId

// Success response (200)
{
  message: 'Tracking session stopped',
  busNumber: string
}
```

### WebSocket Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**Location Update Events (Tracker → Server):**
```typescript
socket.emit('location-update', {
  busNumber: string,
  latitude: number,
  longitude: number,
  accuracy: number,      // GPS accuracy in meters
  timestamp: number      // Current timestamp
});
```

**Connection Management:**
- Connect to WebSocket after successful POST /tracker/start
- Authenticate WebSocket connection using sessionId from API response
- Join tracker room for the specific bus number
- Emit location-update every 10-15 seconds while tracking active
- Handle disconnection scenarios and attempt reconnection

### Project Structure Requirements  
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
File locations for tracker implementation:
```

└── types/
    └── tracker.ts                     # Tracker-related TypeScript interfaces
```

### Backend Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
The tracker endpoints follow the controller/service pattern:
```
apps/backend/src/
├── controllers/
│   └── trackerController.ts           # Request handling for tracker endpoints
├── routes/
│   └── trackerRoutes.ts               # Route definitions
├── services/
│   └── trackingService.ts             # Business logic for session management
├── middleware/
│   └── validation.ts                  # Request validation middleware
└── websocket/
    └── handlers/
        └── trackingHandlers.ts        # WebSocket event handlers
```

### Data Models Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**BusSession Model** - Core entity for single-tracker-per-bus logic:
```typescript
interface BusSession {
  id: string;           // Session identifier for API/WebSocket auth
  busNumber: string;    // Bus being tracked (from Story 2.1 validation)
  trackerId: string;    // Anonymous identifier (no personal data)
  latitude: number;     // Current GPS latitude
  longitude: number;    // Current GPS longitude  
  isActive: boolean;    // Session status
  lastUpdated: Date;    // Last location update timestamp
  expiresAt: Date;      // Auto-cleanup (24 hours)
}
```

**LocationUpdate Model** - Real-time data via WebSocket:
```typescript
interface LocationUpdate {
  busNumber: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;     // GPS accuracy for validation
  timestamp: number;    // Update timestamp
  sessionId: string;    // For authentication
}
```

### State Management Integration
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Zustand store updates required:
```typescript
interface AppState {
  // Existing state...
  userRole: 'consumer' | 'tracker' | null;
  trackingSession: TrackingSession | null;
  isActiveTracker: boolean;
  
  // New actions needed
  startTracking: (busNumber: string) => Promise<void>;
  stopTracking: () => void;
  updateTrackingLocation: (location: Location) => void;
}

interface TrackingSession {
  sessionId: string;
  busNumber: string;
  trackerId: string;
  startedAt: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### Core Workflow Implementation
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
The "Student Becomes Bus Tracker" workflow sequence:
1. **User Input**: Student enters bus number (from Story 2.1 validation)
2. **Location Check**: Get current GPS position with accuracy validation
3. **API Call**: POST /tracker/start with bus number and location
4. **Conflict Handling**: Handle 409 response with user-friendly messaging
5. **Session Start**: Store sessionId and connect WebSocket on success
6. **Location Tracking**: Begin continuous GPS tracking every 10-15 seconds
7. **WebSocket Updates**: Emit location-update events to broadcast location
8. **UI Update**: Show "Currently Tracking Bus X" with Stop button
9. **Background Handling**: Prevent device sleep and handle app state changes

### Device Sleep Prevention Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **react-native-keep-awake**: Keep screen awake during tracking sessions
- **Background Processing**: Handle app backgrounding gracefully
- **Battery Optimization**: Balance tracking accuracy with battery usage
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup timers and listeners when tracking stops

### Location Services Integration
Reuse existing location service from Story 1.5:
- **Permission Management**: Ensure location permissions are active
- **GPS Accuracy**: Validate location accuracy before sending updates  
- **Error Handling**: Handle GPS signal loss and recovery
- **Update Interval**: Implement 10-15 second location update interval
- **Battery Optimization**: Use appropriate location accuracy settings

### Security Considerations  
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Session Validation**: All tracker operations require valid sessionId
- **Anonymous Tracking**: No personal data stored, only trackerId
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all location data
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent excessive API calls from tracker clients
- **WebSocket Auth**: Authenticate WebSocket connections with sessionId

### Error Handling Requirements
- **Network Failures**: Retry logic for API calls and WebSocket connections
- **GPS Issues**: Handle location service failures gracefully  
- **Session Conflicts**: Clear messaging when bus already has tracker
- **Background Transitions**: Maintain tracking when app goes to background
- **Memory Pressure**: Cleanup resources when tracking stops
