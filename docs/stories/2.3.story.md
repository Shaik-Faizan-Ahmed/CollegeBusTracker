## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 completion:
- WebSocket service is established with connection management and reconnection logic
- Bus number validation system is complete (1-50, A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C10)
- Zustand state management includes tracker state - need to extend for consumer state
- Location services are working on both Android and iOS platforms
- TrackerService includes session management with AsyncStorage persistence
- Device sleep prevention using react-native-keep-awake is implemented for trackers

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **React Native CLI 0.72+**: Full native access for maps and GPS integration
- **react-native-maps 1.8+**: Native Google Maps integration for interactive map display
- **@react-native-community/geolocation 3.0+**: Native GPS access for optional user location
- **Zustand 4.4+**: Lightweight state management for consumer tracking state
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time WebSocket connection for location updates

### Consumer API Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**GET /buses/{busNumber}** endpoint for consumer requests:
```typescript
// Success response (200) - Active tracker found
{
  id: string,           // Session identifier
  busNumber: string,    // Bus being tracked
  latitude: number,     // Current GPS latitude
  longitude: number,    // Current GPS longitude
  lastUpdated: Date,    // Last update timestamp
  isActive: boolean     // Session status
}

// Not Found response (404) - No active tracker
{
  error: {
    code: 'NO_ACTIVE_TRACKER',
    message: 'No active tracker found for bus {busNumber}',
    busNumber: string
  }
}
```

**GET /buses/active** endpoint for listing all active buses:
```typescript
// Success response (200)
{
  activeBuses: [
    {
      busNumber: string,
      latitude: number,
      longitude: number,
      lastUpdated: Date
    }
  ]
}
```

### WebSocket Consumer Integration
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**Consumer-specific WebSocket Events:**
```typescript
// Connect as consumer and join bus room
socket.emit('join-bus-room', { busNumber: '12' });

// Receive location updates from tracker
socket.on('location-updated', (data) => {
  // data: { busNumber, latitude, longitude, accuracy, timestamp }
});

// Handle tracker disconnection
socket.on('tracker-disconnected', (data) => {
  // data: { busNumber, reason: 'session_ended' | 'connection_lost' }
});
```

### Consumer Workflow Implementation
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
The "Student Tracks Bus Location" workflow sequence:
1. **User Input**: Student enters bus number (from Story 2.1 validation)
2. **API Check**: GET /buses/{busNumber} to verify active tracker exists
3. **No Tracker Handling**: Display friendly message if 404 response received
4. **Map Initialization**: Initialize map centered on bus location with appropriate zoom
5. **WebSocket Connection**: Connect as consumer and join bus-specific room
6. **Real-time Updates**: Listen for location-updated events and update map markers
7. **Map Interaction**: Allow user zoom/pan while maintaining bus location updates
8. **Disconnection Handling**: Handle tracker-disconnected events gracefully

    └── consumerStore.ts                # Consumer tracking state management
```

### Data Models for Consumer Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**BusSession Model** - Retrieved via consumer API:
```typescript
interface BusSession {
  id: string;           // Session identifier
  busNumber: string;    // Bus being tracked
  trackerId: string;    // Anonymous tracker identifier
  latitude: number;     // Current GPS latitude
  longitude: number;    // Current GPS longitude
  isActive: boolean;    // Session status
  lastUpdated: Date;    // Last location update timestamp
  expiresAt: Date;      // Session expiry
}
```

**LocationUpdate Model** - Real-time WebSocket data:
```typescript
interface LocationUpdate {
  busNumber: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;     // GPS accuracy for display quality
  timestamp: number;    // Update timestamp
}
```

### State Management Extension for Consumers
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
Extend Zustand store for consumer tracking:
```typescript
interface AppState {
  // Existing state...
  userRole: 'consumer' | 'tracker' | null;
  trackingSession: TrackingSession | null;
  
  // New consumer state
  consumerTracking: ConsumerTrackingState | null;
  activeBuses: BusLocation[];
  
  // New consumer actions
  startConsumerTracking: (busNumber: string) => Promise<void>;
  stopConsumerTracking: () => void;
  updateConsumerBusLocation: (location: LocationUpdate) => void;
  fetchActiveBuses: () => Promise<void>;
}

interface ConsumerTrackingState {
  busNumber: string;
  busLocation: BusLocation | null;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  isTrackerActive: boolean;
  wsConnected: boolean;
}

interface BusLocation {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Map Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/components.md]
**react-native-maps Configuration:**
- Google Maps integration with API key configuration
- Custom marker styling for bus and user locations
- Smooth marker animations for location updates
- Proper map region management to avoid jarring resets
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

**Map Component Structure:**
```typescript
interface BusMapProps {
  busLocation: BusLocation;
  busNumber: string;
  userLocation?: BusLocation;
  onMapPress?: () => void;
}

interface MarkerProps {
  coordinate: { latitude: number; longitude: number };
  title: string;
  identifier: string;
  markerType: 'bus' | 'user';
}
```

### Error Handling Requirements
- **Network Failures**: Retry logic for API calls and WebSocket reconnection
- **No Active Tracker**: Clear messaging with suggestions to try different buses
- **GPS Issues**: Handle location service failures for optional user location
- **WebSocket Disconnections**: Automatic reconnection with connection status display
- **Map Loading Issues**: Fallback states and error boundaries for map component

### Performance Considerations
- **Map Rendering**: Optimize marker updates to avoid flickering or jarring movements
- **WebSocket Efficiency**: Only join specific bus rooms to minimize unnecessary data
- **Memory Management**: Properly cleanup map components and WebSocket connections
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient location updates without excessive GPS usage
- **Network Usage**: Minimize API calls by using WebSocket for real-time updates

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Anonymous Consumption**: No personal data required for tracking bus locations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent excessive API calls from consumer clients
- **WebSocket Auth**: Lightweight authentication for consumer WebSocket connections
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for bus numbers before API calls

- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect adherence to unified project structure with proper file organization
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test suite with 73+ test cases covering all functionality at appropriate levels
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Requirements Traceability

**Given-When-Then Coverage Analysis:**

**AC 1: Map displays with bus location marked clearly with bus number identifier**
- **Given** a student opens the track bus screen with valid bus number
- **When** bus location data is available from API
- **Then** map displays with custom BusLocationMarker showing bus number and callout information
- **Tests**: BusLocationMarker.test.tsx covers 12 test scenarios including marker rendering, bus number display, and callout functionality

**AC 2: Map centers on bus location with appropriate zoom level**
- **Given** bus location is received from consumer service
- **When** map region is calculated using mapService.getMapRegion()  
- **Then** map centers on bus with medium zoom level (0.01 delta)
- **Tests**: mapService.test.ts validates region calculations, TrackBusScreen.test.tsx verifies map centering behavior

**AC 3: Location updates refresh automatically every 10-15 seconds**
- **Given** WebSocket connection is established for specific bus
- **When** 'location-updated' events are received via useConsumerWebSocket
- **Then** map markers update with debounced region changes (1000ms debounce)
- **Tests**: useConsumerWebSocket.test.ts covers 9 scenarios including location update handling and real-time functionality

**AC 4: Clear messaging when no active tracker exists**
- **Given** student requests tracking for bus with no active tracker
- **When** API returns 404 NO_ACTIVE_TRACKER error
- **Then** NoTrackerMessage component displays with refresh and "try different bus" options
- **Tests**: NoTrackerMessage.test.tsx covers 12 test cases, consumerService.test.ts validates 404 error handling

**AC 5: Map supports basic zoom and pan functionality**
- **Given** map is displayed with bus location
- **When** user interacts with map controls
- **Then** MapView enables zoom, scroll, and interaction while maintaining location updates
- **Tests**: TrackBusScreen.test.tsx verifies map configuration with proper interaction settings

**AC 6: Bus location marker distinguishes from user's current location marker**
- **Given** both bus and user locations are available
- **When** markers are rendered on map
- **Then** BusLocationMarker (blue circle with bus number) differs from UserLocationMarker (blue dot with ring)
- **Tests**: Both marker components have dedicated test suites validating distinct styling and behavior

### Security Review
