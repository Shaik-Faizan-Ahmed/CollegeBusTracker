## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 and 2.3 completion:
- WebSocket client integration is established in mobile app with connection management
- Tracker functionality includes session management with AsyncStorage persistence
- Consumer functionality uses WebSocket for real-time location updates
- Location services are working with proper validation and accuracy checking

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Express.js 4.18+**: REST API server foundation for WebSocket integration
- **Socket.IO 4.7+**: Real-time WebSocket communication with room-based architecture
- **Supabase PostgreSQL 15+**: Database for session persistence and active tracker management
- **Node-cache 5.1+**: In-memory caching for active room and connection state
- **Jest + Supertest**: Backend testing framework for WebSocket and API testing

### WebSocket Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**WebSocket Event Specifications:**

**Tracker Events (Mobile → Server):**
```typescript
// Location update from tracker
socket.emit('location-update', {
  busNumber: '12',
  latitude: 17.3850,
  longitude: 78.4867,
  accuracy: 10.5,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  sessionId: string
});
```

**Server Broadcast Events (Server → Consumers):**
```typescript
// Location update broadcast to all consumers in bus room
socket.emit('location-updated', {
  busNumber: '12',
  latitude: 17.3850,
  longitude: 78.4867,
  accuracy: 10.5,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Tracker disconnected notification
socket.emit('tracker-disconnected', {
  busNumber: '12',
  reason: 'session_ended' | 'connection_lost',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

**Consumer Events (Mobile → Server):**
```typescript
// Join specific bus room for updates
socket.emit('join-bus-room', {
  busNumber: '12',
  consumerId: string
});

// Leave bus room
socket.emit('leave-bus-room', {
  busNumber: '12',
  consumerId: string
});
```

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
**WebSocket File Structure:**
```
apps/backend/src/
├── websocket/
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── trackingHandlers.ts      # Tracker event handlers
│   │   ├── consumerHandlers.ts      # Consumer event handlers
│   │   └── connectionHandlers.ts    # Connection management
│   ├── middleware/
│   │   ├── websocketAuth.ts         # WebSocket authentication
│   │   └── sessionValidator.ts      # Session validation
│   ├── rooms.ts                     # Room management utilities
│   └── index.ts                     # WebSocket server setup
└── services/
    └── websocketService.ts          # WebSocket business logic
```

### Data Models for WebSocket Communication
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**LocationUpdate Model** - Real-time WebSocket data:
```typescript
interface LocationUpdate {
  busNumber: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;
  timestamp: number;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

**WebSocketConnection Model** - Connection tracking:
```typescript
interface WebSocketConnection {
  socketId: string;
  type: 'tracker' | 'consumer';
  busNumber: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  connectedAt: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
}
```

**BusRoom Model** - Room state management:
```typescript
interface BusRoom {
  busNumber: string;
  trackerId?: string;
  consumerCount: number;
  lastUpdate: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### WebSocket Room Management Architecture
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
**Room-based Architecture:**
1. **Bus-specific Rooms**: Each bus gets dedicated room (e.g., "bus-12")
2. **Tracker Assignment**: Only one tracker per bus room allowed
3. **Consumer Subscriptions**: Multiple consumers can join same bus room
4. **Real-time Broadcasting**: Location updates broadcast to all room subscribers
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Rooms cleaned up when tracker disconnects

### Database Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
**BusSession Management via WebSocket:**
- Update `bus_sessions` table on location-update events
- Mark sessions inactive on tracker disconnect
- Enforce unique active tracker constraint at database level
- Use `active_buses` view for consumer API queries

### Authentication and Security
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
**WebSocket Authentication:**
```typescript
// Session validation middleware for WebSocket connections
export const validateWebSocketSession = async (
  socket: Socket,
  sessionData: any
): Promise<boolean> => {
  const { sessionId, type } = sessionData;
  
  if (type === 'tracker') {
    const session = await databaseService.findActiveSession(sessionId);
    return session && session.is_active;
  }
  
  // Consumers don't require session validation
  return type === 'consumer';
};
```

### Error Handling and Resilience
**Connection Management:**
- Automatic reconnection logic for network failures
- Session state persistence across disconnections
- Graceful degradation when tracker disconnects
- Rate limiting for location update events
- Connection timeout handling for idle connections

**Data Validation:**
- Location coordinate validation (latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180)
- GPS accuracy thresholds (minimum 100m accuracy)
- Bus number format validation
- Timestamp validation for update ordering

### Performance Optimization
**WebSocket Efficiency:**
- Room-based broadcasting to minimize unnecessary data transmission
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Memory cleanup for disconnected clients
- Efficient JSON serialization for location updates
- Rate limiting to prevent spam updates

**Database Optimization:**
- Batch location updates to reduce database writes
- Index optimization for active session queries
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Cleanup of expired sessions to maintain performance

### Files Modified During Review

None - Critical compilation errors prevent safe modifications

### Gate Status

**Gate: FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.4-real-time-location-broadcasting-system.yml

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Test compilation failures prevent verification of core functionality

### Recommended Status

**❌ Changes Required** - Critical compilation and test issues must be resolved before this story can be marked as Done.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors in test files
